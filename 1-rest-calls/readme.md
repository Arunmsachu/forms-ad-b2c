This example shows how to invoke a Web API from a Xamarin.Forms application.

The Web.API is a .NET Core Web API application, and of course the Xamarin.Forms project is a Xamarin.Forms app - made with a .NET Standard 2.0 core project.

There is an accompaning blog post to all of this madness and it can be found [here](https://msou.co/6r).
